# CNN Classifier on iNaturalist Dataset

## Dataset

The project uses the **iNaturalist** dataset, a large-scale image classification dataset focused on species of animals, plants, and fungi. Each image is labeled with its corresponding category, and the dataset is typically used for fine-grained classification tasks. In this implementation, the images are organized in a directory structure compatible with `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder`, making it easy to load and preprocess.
